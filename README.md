# PhotographicEnhancement
This graduation project is a mobile terminal of Android platform for image enhancement under uneven lighting conditions. ＜/br＞
The algorithm which this project used can be roughly divided into two steps: ＜/br＞
1.The initial enhanced image is generated based on a simplified retinex model using guided image filter.＜/br＞
2.The final result is achieved by a linear fusion with lightness map, in which the lightness map weighs between the enhanced weakly-illuminated regions and the reserved normally-illuminated regions.
